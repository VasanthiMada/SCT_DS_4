# Task 4 - Traffic Accident Data Analysis

Welcome to my submission for **Task 4** of the Data Science Internship at **Skill Craft**. In this task, I have analyzed **traffic accident data** to identify patterns related to **road conditions, weather, and time of day**. Additionally, I have visualized accident hotspots and contributing factors to gain insights into accident trends.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task contains **records of traffic accidents**, including information about the date, time, location, weather conditions, road conditions, and severity of accidents. This dataset helps in understanding the factors that contribute to accidents and identifying high-risk areas.

## Tools and Libraries used
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **Folium** for geographic accident hotspot mapping

## Data Analysis and Visualization
During the analysis process, I performed the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, handled inconsistencies, and converted date/time fields into appropriate formats.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed the distribution of accidents based on **time of day, day of the week, and season**.
   - Investigated the impact of **road conditions and weather** on accident severity.
   - Explored accident severity trends across different **locations**.
3. **Visualization**:
   - Used **bar charts and line plots** to identify trends in accident frequency.
   - Created **heatmaps** to visualize accident hotspots based on location data.
   - Mapped accident locations using **Folium** to highlight high-risk areas.

## Conclusion
This analysis provided valuable insights into the factors contributing to traffic accidents. Identifying **patterns related to weather, road conditions, and time of day** can help in implementing measures to reduce accidents and improve road safety. The visualization of accident hotspots enables authorities to focus on high-risk areas for better traffic management.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
